TODO: 
  - get mutation observer working for small and large chats
  - make sure draw function from delimters branch works properly
    - something curretly causing paragraphs to end up inside code blocks. (I think it could be running draw() on newly drawn elements)
  - add user customizable options
  - clean up excess styles from highlight
